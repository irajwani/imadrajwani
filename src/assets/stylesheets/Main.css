/* 
px (pixels): The number of pixels high you want the text to be. This is an absolute unit â€” it results in the same final computed value for the font on the page in pretty much any situation.
ems: 1em is equal to the font size set on the parent element of the current element we are styling (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M contained inside the parent element.)
 This can become tricky to work out if you have a lot of nested elements with different font sizes set, but it is doable, as you'll see below. 
 Why bother? 
 It is quite natural once you get used to it, and you can use ems to size everything, not just text. You can have an entire website sized using ems, which makes maintenance easy.
rems: These work just like ems, except that 1rem is equal to the font size set on the root element of the document (i.e. <html>), not the parent element. 
This makes doing the maths to work out your font sizes much easier, but unfortunately rems are not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.
 If you need to support older browsers with your project, you can either stick to using ems or px, or use a polyfill such as REM-unit-polyfill.
